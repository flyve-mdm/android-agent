The Android Agent works in conjuction with the [Web MDM Dashboard](http://flyve.org/web-mdm-dashboard/) and [Flyve MDM plugin](http://flyve.org/glpi-plugin/) for GLPI.

The Agent will take control of the Android devices in your IT Infrastructure while from the Web Dashboard and GLPI plugin the Administrator will be able to manage all the terminals, once these are enrolled.

Thanks to the MQTT, a Machine to Machine protocol, the Agent is capable of maintaining a connection with the backend, which gives you remote control over your fleet.

The Agent counts with an intuitive and simple User Interface that helps you through the enrollment process.

It will also provide you information of the user and supervisor of the infrastructure.
